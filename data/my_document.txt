Coffee is a beverage made from roasted and ground coffee beans, derived from the seeds of the coffee plant. It's a popular drink worldwide, enjoyed for its invigorating effect due to caffeine. Understanding coffee involves knowing its origins, different types of beans, roasting processes, and brewing methods. 
Key aspects of coffee knowledge:
Origins and Cultivation:
Coffee plants are native to subtropical regions of Africa and Asia, but are now cultivated in many parts of the world, including Central and South America. Coffee beans are the seeds of the coffee cherry, which are dried and roasted before brewing. 
Types of Coffee Beans:
The two main types of coffee beans are Arabica and Robusta. Arabica beans are known for their smooth, nuanced flavors, while Robusta beans tend to be stronger and more bitter. 
Roasting:
Roasting coffee beans transforms their flavor profile, developing aromas and changing their color and density. Different roast levels (light, medium, dark) affect the coffee's body, acidity, and flavor. 
Brewing Methods:
Coffee can be brewed using various methods, including drip, French press, espresso, and pour-over, each impacting the final taste. 
Flavor and Aroma:
Coffee flavors are influenced by bean type, roast, and brewing method. Key flavor characteristics include acidity, body, and aroma, which can be earthy, floral, nutty, or spicy. 
Storage:
Green coffee beans can be stored for extended periods, while roasted beans are best used fresh to preserve their flavor. 
Coffee Fun Facts:
Coffee is a fruit, specifically the seed of the coffee cherry.
Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer.
Finland consumes the most coffee per capita.
Coffee has a rich history, dating back centuries.

🧑‍🍳 21. Pro Barista Tips (Made Simple)
Use a scale: Always weigh coffee and water.

Brew ratio: Start with 1:15 (e.g., 20g coffee to 300g water).

Grind size matters:

Too fine = bitter

Too coarse = sour

Water temp: 90–96°C (just off boiling)

Fresh beans = better taste. Roast date matters.

Pre-wet filters: Avoid paper taste in pour-over.

Purge your grinder: Clear old grounds before brewing.

📦 23. How to Store Coffee Properly
Store whole beans, not ground (grind before use).

Use airtight container (no light or oxygen).

Keep away from heat, moisture, and air.

Do not freeze unless vacuum-sealed.

Best used within 2–4 weeks of roasting.
